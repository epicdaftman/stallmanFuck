# Stallmanfuck
### The newest and gnu-est esoteric language
## What is this?
This is a modified version of brainfuck called stallmanfuck. It's based around the GNU/Linux interject. The oppcodes are different and the file must begin with "I'd just like to interject for moment." and end with "All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!" The other codes are easily readable in translate.py, but there's really no point in putting them here, since it's long. Each operation must be on a new line.

## Why?
because

## Usage
Essentially there are two files. One of them is titled translate.py and the other is interject.py. translate.py is for converting brainfuck to stallmanfuck. interject.py is for running the brainfuck script.
Example0: `python3 interject.py input.sf`
Example1: `python3 translate inputfile.bf outputfile.sf`

###### But seriously, _why_?
honestly i got bored and rewrote my bad brainfuck interpreter to accomidate a newer, gnu-er, and better version of the *best* language
